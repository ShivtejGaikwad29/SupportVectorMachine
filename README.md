# SupportVectorMachine
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a supervised learning algorithm that applies the principles of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to regression problems. Unlike traditional linear regression, SVR aims to fit the best decision boundary within a specified margin of tolerance, known as the epsilon-insensitive tube. This approach helps in minimizing the error for data points outside the tube while capturing the majority of data points within it.

Key Features:

Epsilon-Insensitive Tube: SVR fits a decision boundary with a margin of tolerance, reducing the impact of outliers.
Kernel Trick: Supports various kernel functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF) to handle non-linear relationships.
Support Vectors: Only a subset of training data points, called support vectors, are used to define the decision boundary, making the model efficient.

Implementation:
This repository includes templates for implementing SVR in Python using popular libraries such as scikit-learn. It also provides example datasets and Jupyter notebooks to help you get started.
