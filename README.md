# SupportVectorMachine
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a supervised learning algorithm that applies the principles of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to regression problems. Unlike traditional linear regression, SVR aims to fit the best decision boundary within a specified margin of tolerance, known as the epsilon-insensitive tube.
